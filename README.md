The NRA is an effort by the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas to promote revitalization, conservation, and redevelopment of designated areas through tax rebate incentives on new construction and improvements.

# What problems do we want to address?

### Utilization and Awareness

The benefits available through the NRA go under-utilized, and awareness of the program is limited.

### Education

It's hard for those who might benefit to understand benefits and details of the NRA and similar programs.

### Process

When somebody does decide to take advantage of the NRA, it's hard to understand the process.
